# TASK 3

Created a Tinkercad project using an Arduino to control a servo motor via serial input.Used six servo motors, each representing a joint of a robotic arm and controlled them using an array of angles received via serial input.
Implemented a pseudo-simultaneous movement for smoother operation.
