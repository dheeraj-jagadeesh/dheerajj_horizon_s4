# Nearest Neighbor Plotter

This Python program allows users to input a set of points and visualize the nearest neighbor connections between them. It uses the `matplotlib` library to plot the points and draw lines to their nearest neighbors.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the program:

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib

## Installation

### Windows

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install matplotlib**:
   - Open Command Prompt.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     pip install matplotlib
     ```

### Ubuntu

1. **Install Python**:
   - Open Terminal.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3
     sudo apt install python3-pip
     ```

2. **Install matplotlib**:
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     pip3 install matplotlib
     ```

## Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt**.
2. **Navigate to the directory** where the program file is located.
3. **Run the program** using the following command:

4. **Input the number of points** when prompted.
5. **Enter the coordinates** for each point in the format `x y`.

The program will then plot the points and draw lines to their nearest neighbors.

## Example

Enter the number of points: 3 Enter coordinates for point 1 (x y): 1 1 Enter coordinates for point 2 (x y): 2 3 Enter coordinates for point 3 (x y): 4 2



This will generate a plot with the points (1,1), (2,3), and (4,2) and draw lines connecting each point to its nearest neighbor.
